title: Naptime.dev - Enter the Bloggin'
description: By nobody's request, I have a blog!
---

I'm finally doing it. I'm joining the oversaturated blogosphere - 
but this one is different, I promise! I have some ideas I've been wanting to get out there,
and quarantine has taken away my excuses. Here are the main categories I'm going to
discuss:

### Same Coin Culture
Something that has become very apparent in the last year (okay 4 years,
but 2020 is something special) is that we disagree, and we do it in
the way that only a preteen and her younger brother should be able to. I'd like to explore
these differences one opinion at a time, coming from different people with different
opinions and reconcile our differences like friends who might still disagree but want
to understand each other.

### The Terrific Tuber
Maybe the _most_ important, most prominent issue in my life right now is my daughter's health.
She has been fighting with muscular and feeding issues, "diagnosed" when she was 8 weeks old.
She has been fed through an NG tube since. I want to share her story, to bring awareness and understanding
to her situation, as well as the lives of people with similar -usually worse- life conditions.

### Naptime
Nathan Andrew Phelps. NAP. Somethings are just worth sharing. You should know about them.
I'll open up a bit about what I think is important, but uncategorized.

### .dev
Dev things. Could be Dev news. Could be my favorite latest CodePen.
Whatever suits my web developer fancy that I want to share.
