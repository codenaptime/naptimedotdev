title: Same Coin Culture
description: So I've been sitting on an idea for a while...
---

A grandiose idea of healing public discourse, helping people
communicate honestly. We've been at our worst for a while, littering the internet with anxiety
and disengenuous fingerpointing. We always talk about other people living in "echo chambers",
not wanting to engage in civil discourse with people who disagree with them.

__*It's true; we all do it.*__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyday I cringe at the staggering amount of disengenuous accusations made, simply for clicks and claps.
So many sincerely _important_ topics fade into intellectual bear traps that snap shut the
second a person appears to disagree. We never believe someone has a third possible option for
a hot-button issue. We have already created two different one-dimensional,
Fascist characters a person could possibly be.

1. Do you think the police overall do good work? You're a police-state supporting, racist crony capitalist who wants
to control women's bodies. You could own a tank and hide it in an underground bunker and
use it to lead a caravan of black and brown Mexican Muslims South of the border where they came from
and dump them behind the wall you're expecting Mexico to pay for so that you can protect
your homophobic theocracy while you wear your MAGA hat (that doubles as the KKK hood you wear to
mass lynchings). You don't care if children die because "'muh freedoms".

2. Oh, you wear a mask to because "Coronavirus is more than a hoax"? You're a pride-marching, gender-transitioning,
God-hating, Bible-burning Antifa (actual Fascist) who thinks all hints of masculinity are toxic and wants
Planned Parenthood to kill all of the Black babies. All while also looting and burning federal
buildings at the Marxist Black Lives Matter protests, expressing disdain for all Southerners and
want to displace Judeo-Christian values with Sharia law (which in a roundabout way means that _you_
are the one who truly wants to oppress women). You're a Communist, libtard soyboy.

**Quick Quiz:** _Which one am I?_

### We can do better

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to allow people to express what they truly feel on an issue and address
what they think their intellectual opposition misunderstands (probably on purpose). My hope is
that we will all be able to hold mature conversations beyond memes that "owl the libs" or
"dunk on the cons".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My theory is that we all have similar (not the same) end goals and need to start being intellectually
honest when we disagree online. I'm 92.3% certain that 93.2% of us don't want innocent Black men
getting killed by the police. I think we are two sides of the same cultural coin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a concept in progress, and I'd love some feedback. Send me an email on what you'd like
to see. My end goal is to give a platform to people with disagreeing view points and share them
side by side. I want to perfect the most efficient format I can, so let me know your thoughts and ideas,
including what topics you are interested in.
