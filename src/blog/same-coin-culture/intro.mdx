description: So I've been sitting on an idea for a while...

A grandiose idea of healing public discourse, helping - or maybe forcing - people to
communicate honestly. I'm mostly referring to online communication, because, let's be honest,
we've been at our worst for a while. We always talk about other people living in "echo chambers",
not wanting to engage in civil discourse with people who disagree with them.

__*It's true; we all do it.*__

Everyday I cringe at the staggering amount of disengenuous accusations made, simply for clicks and claps.
So many sincerely _important_ topics fade into intellectual bear traps that snap shut the
second a person appears to disagree. We never get past a third possible option for
a hot-button issue. we hace already created two different one-dimensional,
fascistic characters that you could be.

1. Do you oppose abortion? You're a police-state supporting racist crony capitalist who want
to control women's bodies, wishes they could own a tank and hide it in an underground bunker
use it to lead a caravan of black and brown Mexican Muslims south of the border where they came from
and dump them behind the wall you're expecting Mexico to pay for so that you can protect
your homophobic theocracy while you wear your red MAGA hat that doubles as a KKK hood to
mass lynchings. You self-loathing Uncle Tom.

2. Do you have think that coronavirus is an acutal threat? You're a pride-marching gender
transitioning, God-hating anarchist who thinks all hints of masculinity are toxic and wants
Planned Parenthood to kill all of the Black babies while also looting and burning federal
buildings at the Marxist Black Lives Matter protests to express disdain for all Southerners and
want to displace Judeo-Christian values with Sharia law which in a roundabout way means that _you_
are the one who truly wants to oppress women. You're a Communist libtard soyboy.

**Quick Quiz:** _Which one am I?_

### We can move us past that

I want to allow people to express what they truly feel on an issue and address
what they think their intellectual opposition is getting wrong about them. My hope is
that we will all be able to mature in our idea sharing and inevtiable disagreements.

My theory is that we all have similar (not equivalent) end goals and need to start begin being intellectually
honest and lower each other's mental stress when we open our browsers. I think we are two sides of
the same cultural coin.

This is a concept in progress, and I'd love some feedback. Send me an email on what you'd like
to see. My hopes is to give a platform to other people with disagreeing view points and share them
side by side. I want to perfect the most efficient format I can, so let me know your thoughts and ideas,
including what topics you are interested in.
